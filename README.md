# Power-BI-Project-1
Project Title: Employee Attrition Analysis in a Multinational Corporation (MNC)

📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The analysis explores patterns and root causes of employee turnover within a multinational corporation. By leveraging simulated HR data, this report provides actionable insights to reduce attrition rates, improve job satisfaction, and enhance employee retention strategies.

🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key drivers of employee attrition and offer data-backed recommendations to HR teams for:
- Improving job satisfaction
- Enhancing work-life balance
- Reducing voluntary attrition rate
- Retaining top talent

📊 Key Metrics & Visuals

1. KPIs

   - Avg. Job Satisfaction Score

2. Attrition Insights
   - By Cause (e.g., Career Growth, Workload, Low Pay)
   - By Department and Job Role
   - By Age, Gender, and Tenure

3. Trends & Comparative Analysis
   - Attrition vs. Job Satisfaction by Department
   - Income vs. Work-Life Balance
   - Gender-based Retention Trends
   - Exit Interview Scores

4. Resignation Cause Breakdown
   - Visualized through a donut chart
   - Cross-filtered by department

🧠 Data Sources

Simulated HR datasets include:
- Employees.csv – Core employee details
- Attrition.csv – Attrition status and exit reason
- Departments.csv – Department metadata

🔧 Tools & Features Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (Data Transformation)
- DAX Measures & Calculated Columns
- What-If Parameter (Job Satisfaction Impact Simulation)
- Slicers, Cards, Line Charts, Donut Charts, Bar Graphs

📈 Insights & Outcomes

- Departments with the highest attrition are often those with low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance.
- The leading causes of employee exits include: lack of career growth, workload stress, and relocation.
- Tenure trends reveal the highest attrition risk occurs at 6–8 years of service.
- Male employees show higher retention compared to females and others, suggesting potential equity issues.
- Simulating a +1 boost in job satisfaction across the board results in measurable reductions in projected attrition.
